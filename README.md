## Quick Start

Create a new Terraform file with `artifactory` resources. Also see [sample.tf](./sample.tf):

<details><summary>HCL Example</summary>

```terraform
# Required for Terraform 0.13 and up (https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html)
terraform {
  required_providers {
    artifactory = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/jfrog/artifactory"
      version = "6.6.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "artifactory" {
  // supply ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME, ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN, and ARTIFACTORY_URL as env vars
}

resource "artifactory_local_pypi_repository" "pypi-local" {
  key         = "pypi-local"
  description = "Repo created by Terraform Provider Artifactory"
}

resource "artifactory_artifact_webhook" "artifact-webhook" {
  key         = "artifact-webhook"
  event_types = ["deployed", "deleted", "moved", "copied"]
  criteria {
    any_local        = true
    any_remote       = false
    repo_keys        = [artifactory_local_pypi_repository.pypi-local.key]
    include_patterns = ["foo/**"]
    exclude_patterns = ["bar/**"]
  }
  url    = "http://tempurl.org/webhook"
  secret = "some-secret"
  proxy  = "proxy-key"

  custom_http_headers = {
    header-1 = "value-1"
    header-2 = "value-2"
  }

  depends_on = [artifactory_local_pypi_repository.pypi-local]
}
```
</details>

Initialize Terrform:
```sh
$ terraform init
```

Plan (or Apply):
```sh
$ terraform plan
```

## Documentation

To use this provider in your Terraform module, follow the documentation on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/artifactory/latest/docs).

## License requirements

This provider requires access to Artifactory APIs, which are only available in the _licensed_ pro and enterprise editions. You can determine which license you have by accessing the following URL `${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/`

You can either access it via API, or web browser - it requires admin level credentials, but it's one of the few APIs that will work without a license (side node: you can also install your license here with a `POST`)

```sh
$ curl -sL ${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/ | jq .
```

```js
{
  "type" : "Enterprise Plus Trial",
  "validThrough" : "Jan 29, 2022",
  "licensedTo" : "JFrog Ltd"
}
```

The following 3 license types (`jq .type`) do **NOT** support APIs:
- Community Edition for C/C++
- JCR Edition
- OSS

## Versioning

In general, this project follows [Terraform Versioning Specification](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/best-practices/versioning#versioning-specification) as closely as we can for tagging releases of the package.
