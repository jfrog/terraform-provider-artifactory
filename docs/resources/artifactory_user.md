# Artifactory User Resource

Provides an Artifactory user resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory users.

Note: User passwords are never returned through the API. Since they are never returned they cannot be managed by 
directly through Terraform. However, it is possible to store a "known" state for the password and make changes if it's
updated in Terraform. Removing the password argument does not reset the password; it just removes Terraform from storing the "known"
state.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new Artifactory user called terraform
resource "artifactory_user" "test-user" {
  name     = "terraform"
  email    = "test-user@artifactory-terraform.com"
  groups   = ["logged-in-users", "readers"]
  password = "my super secret password"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Username for user.
* `email` - (Required) Email for user.
* `admin` - (Optional) When enabled, this user is an administrator with all the ensuing privileges. Default value is `false`.
* `profile_updatable` - (Optional) When set, this user can update his profile details (except for the password. Only an administrator can update the password). Default value is `true`.
* `disable_ui_access` - (Optional) When set, this user can only access Artifactory through the REST API. This option cannot be set if the user has Admin privileges. Default value is `true`.
* `internal_password_disabled` - (Optional) When set, disables the fallback of using an internal password when external authentication (such as LDAP) is enabled.
* `groups` - (Optional) List of groups this user is a part of.
* `password` - (Required) Password for the user. Password validation is not done by the provider and is offloaded onto the Artifactory. There may be cases in which you want to leave this unset to prevent users from updating their profile. For example, a departmental user with a single password shared between all department members.

## Import

Users can be imported using their name, e.g.

```
$ terraform import artifactory_user.test-user myusername
```
