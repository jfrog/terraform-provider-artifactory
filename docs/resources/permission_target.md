# Artifactory Permission Target Resource

Provides an Artifactory permission target resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory permission targets.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new Artifactory permission target called testpermission
resource "artifactory_permission_target" "test-perm" {
  name = "test-perm"

  repo {
    includes_pattern = ["foo/**"]
    excludes_pattern = ["bar/**"]
    repositories     = ["example-repo-local"]

    actions {
      users {
        name        = "anonymous"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }

      users {
        name        = "user1"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }

      groups {
        name        = "readers"
        permissions = ["read"]
      }

      groups {
        name        = "dev"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }
    }
  }

  build {
    includes_pattern = ["**"]
    repositories     = ["artifactory-build-info"]

    actions {
      users {
        name        = "anonymous"
        permissions = ["read"]
      }

      users {
        name        = "user1"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }
    }
  }

  release_bundle {
    includes_pattern = ["**"]
    repositories     = ["release-bundles"]

    actions {
      users {
        name         = "anonymous"
        permissions  = ["read"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Permission targets can be imported using their name, e.g.

```
$ terraform import artifactory_permission_target.terraform-test-permission mypermission
```
